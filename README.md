# DelayBasedForwarding

DelayBasedForwarding is an open source project to evaluate the Latency-Based Forwarding (LBF) concept based on:

    A. Clemm and T. Eckert, “High-Precision Latency Forwarding over Packet-Programmable Networks,”
    in NOMS 2020 - 2020 IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium, 2020, pp. 1–8.
    doi: 10.1109/NOMS47738.2020.9110431.

This implementation is developed with OMNeT++ 5.6.2 and INET framework 4.2.0
