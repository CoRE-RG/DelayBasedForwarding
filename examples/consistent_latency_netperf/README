Demonstrates Delay-Based Forwarding (DBF) using TCP.

 - The network consists of two senders, two receivers and four routers.
   
 - The senders are denoted by an S in the beginning of their name.
 
 - The receivers are denoted by an R in the beginning of their name.
 
 - Senders have the name of the receiver in the name to which they send traffic.
 
 - All senders send DBF traffic to their according receiver.
   See omnetpp.ini for the Service Level Objectives (SLO).
 
 - The path between S1_R1 and R1 has a shorter delay than the path
   between S2_R2 and R2. (see consistentLatency.ned)
